The software is part of my masters thesis "Discovering Declarative Process Models Using Temporal Logic Query Checking". The title may seem a bit scary at first, but actually it is fearly simlple concept.

The dependencies are BuDDy (http://sourceforge.net/projects/buddy/) and expat (http://expat.sourceforge.net/).

Currently it is tested only on 64bit Windows 7 with TDM-GCC, but sould build and run on other systems as well.
